- ANN (Artificial Neural Network):
	General-purpose network for structured data.
	Made up of fully connected layers (input, hidden, output).

- CNN (Convolutional Neural Network):
	Specialized for processing spatial data (e.g., images).
	Uses convolutional, pooling, and fully connected layers.

 - Key Differences:

Input Data:

ANN: Works well with structured, tabular data.
CNN: Handles image data and spatial information effectively.
	Feature Extraction:

ANN: Requires manual feature extraction (features need to be predefined).
CNN: Automatically extracts features (e.g., edges, textures, patterns).
	Architecture:

ANN: Fully connected neurons in every layer.
CNN: Convolutional layers scan input images with filters to extract spatial features.
-Layers in CNN:

Convolutional Layer:
	Detects features in the image using filters.
	Each filter extracts specific patterns (e.g., edges, curves).
Pooling Layer:
	Reduces the spatial dimensions of the feature maps.
	Helps retain important features while reducing computations.
Fully Connected Layer:
	Similar to ANN, used for classification or regression tasks.

 - Applications:
ANN:
Structured data tasks like fraud detection, recommendation systems.
Time series and NLP tasks.
CNN:
Image recognition, object detection, facial recognition.
Medical imaging and self-driving cars.
Advantages:

ANN:
Flexible and works on different types of input data.
CNN:
Automatically learns spatial hierarchies of features (low-level to high-level).
Reduces the need for manual preprocessing in image tasks.
Limitations:

ANN:
Struggles with high-dimensional data like images.
CNN:
Computationally expensive due to heavy operations.
Performance:

CNN outperforms ANN in image-related tasks because it understands spatial hierarchies (e.g., pixels close to each other are analyzed together).
Conclusion:

ANN is a general-purpose neural network.
CNN is designed specifically for image data, utilizing convolutional and pooling layers to extract features effectively.
