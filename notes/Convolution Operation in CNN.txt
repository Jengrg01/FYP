 --- Convolution Operation ----

 - A mathematical operation that combines two functions to produce a third function, expressing how the shape of one is modified by the other.
 - In CNNs, it involves sliding a filter (kernel) over the input data to produce feature maps.

 ---- Key Components ----

 - Input Image: 
	Represented as a matrix of pixel values.
	For grayscale images: 2D matrix; for RGB images: 3D matrix with depth corresponding to color channels.

 - Filter (Kernel):
	A small matrix of weights, typically of size 3x3 or 5x5.
	Detects specific features like edges, textures, or patterns.

 - Feature Map:
	The output matrix after applying the filter across the input image.
	Highlights the presence of specific features detected by the filter.

 ------- Convolution Process -------


 - Sliding the Filter:
	The filter moves across the input image with a defined stride (step size).
	At each position, an element-wise multiplication is performed between the filter and the corresponding region of the image.

 - Summation:
	The results of the element-wise multiplication are summed to produce a single value.
	This value becomes a pixel in the feature map.

 - Activation Function:
	Often, a non-linear activation function like ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit) is applied to introduce non-linearity, enabling the network to learn complex patterns.

 - Padding and Stride:

   - Padding: Adding extra pixels around the input image to control the spatial dimensions of the output feature map.

   - Types:
	Valid Padding: No padding; results in a smaller output.
	Same Padding: Pads the input so that the output has the same dimensions as the input.

   - Stride:
	The number of pixels by which the filter moves across the input image.
	Larger strides result in smaller feature maps, reducing computational load.

------Importance in CNNs -------
- Convolution operations enable CNNs to detect local patterns and build complex representations through multiple layers.
- They allow for parameter sharing and sparse connectivity, making CNNs efficient and effective for image and signal processing tasks.
