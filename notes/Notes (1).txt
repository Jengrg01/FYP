Model Training
Data Collection: Gather a diverse dataset of facial images with various makeup styles and preferences.
Preprocessing: Normalize images, resize them to a standard dimension, and apply augmentation techniques (rotation, flipping, brightness adjustments) to improve generalization.
Model Selection: Use Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) due to their strong feature extraction capabilities for image-based tasks.
Training Process:
Use a well-labeled dataset (makeup vs. non-makeup, various makeup styles).
Split data into training, validation, and test sets.
Implement batch training with appropriate batch sizes.

Problems Faced When Training the Data
Insufficient Data:
Makeup datasets are limited compared to general face datasets.
Synthetic augmentation may not fully replicate real-world makeup application.
Class Imbalance:
Some makeup styles may have fewer examples, leading to biased predictions.
Solution: Use oversampling, undersampling, or weighted loss functions.
Overfitting:
The model may memorize training data instead of generalizing.
Solution: Implement dropout layers, data augmentation, and regularization (L2 norm).
Difficulties in Feature Extraction:
Subtle makeup differences may be hard to distinguish.
Solution: Use deeper CNN architectures or attention-based networks.
Processing Power Requirements:
Training large models requires high GPU resources.
Solution: Use cloud-based training (Google Colab, AWS, or TPU-based training).
Latency in Real-Time Applications:
Real-time makeup recommendations should be fast.
Solution: Optimize model size using pruning and quantization.
Variability in Lighting and Skin Tone:
Different lighting conditions affect model predictions.
Solution: Use a diverse dataset covering various lighting and skin tones.
