Transfer learning is a machine learning technique where a model developed for a particular task is reused as the starting
 point for a model on a second task. In the context of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), 
transfer learning is often used to leverage pre-trained models, typically trained on large datasets like ImageNet,
 and fine-tune them on smaller, task-specific datasets. This approach is especially useful when there is limited data 
available for the new task, as the model can retain the general features learned from the original dataset.

CNNs, with their hierarchical structure, excel in learning spatial hierarchies of features such as edges, 
textures, and objects. The first layers of CNNs typically capture low-level features, while the deeper layers c
apture more abstract, high-level representations. When applying transfer learning, the lower layers of a pre-trained 
CNN often provide generalized features that are useful across different domains, while the higher layers can be fine-tuned to adapt to the specific task.

Using transfer learning in CNNs significantly reduces training time and computational resources.
 It also improves model performance, particularly when there is limited labeled data for the target task,
 by utilizing the rich feature representations already learned by the pre-trained model.

in the context of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) involves taking a pre-trained model, 
which has been trained on a large dataset, and adapting it for a different but related task. This technique is highly beneficial when 
the target task has limited data available, allowing the model to capitalize on the general features learned during the pre-training phase. 
Instead of training a CNN from scratch, which requires large datasets and significant computational power, transfer learning allows for faster 
convergence and improved performance with fewer data.
