Image Data Augmentation
What is Image Data Augmentation?
Image data augmentation is the process of applying transformations to existing images in a dataset to create new, slightly modified versions.
It helps improve the generalization ability of machine learning models, especially in computer vision tasks.
Used to increase dataset size, reduce overfitting, and make models more robust to variations in real-world data.

Why is Image Data Augmentation Important?
Helps when there is limited data
Prevents overfitting by exposing the model to diverse variations
Makes models more robust to changes in lighting, orientation, scale, etc.
Reduces data collection costs

Common Image Augmentation Techniques
1. Geometric Transformations
Flipping: Mirror images horizontally or vertically.
Rotation: Rotate images by a fixed/random degree (e.g., 90°, 180°).
Scaling: Resize images while maintaining aspect ratio.
Cropping: Extract smaller portions of an image.
Translation (Shifting): Move images horizontally or vertically.
2. Color-Based Transformations
Brightness Adjustment: Increase or decrease image brightness.
Contrast Enhancement: Make colors more distinct.
Saturation & Hue Adjustment: Modify color intensity.
Grayscale Conversion: Convert images to black and white.
3. Noise Addition & Blurring
Gaussian Noise: Adds random noise to the image.
Salt-and-Pepper Noise: Random black-and-white pixel disturbances.
Blurring (Gaussian, Motion, Median): Reduces image sharpness.
4. Occlusion & Random Erasing
Cutout: Mask random parts of the image with black or white patches.
Grid Masking: Apply a grid-like mask over the image.
5. Mixing & Advanced Techniques
MixUp: Blends two images together.
CutMix: Cuts a portion from one image and pastes it onto another.
Style Transfer: Changes the artistic style of an image.

Image Augmentation Libraries
TensorFlow/Keras (ImageDataGenerator)
OpenCV (Basic image processing)

Image data augmentation is essential for improving model performance in computer vision.
Choosing the right augmentations depends on the task (e.g., object detection, classification).
Helps create more diverse training data without manually collecting new images.
