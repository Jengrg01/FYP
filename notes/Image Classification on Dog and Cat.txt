Objective
I worked on an image classification project to distinguish between cats and dogs using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). To improve accuracy and reduce training time, I incorporated transfer learning.

Dataset Preparation
I used a publicly available dataset of cat and dog images. Before training, I preprocessed the images by resizing and normalizing them. I also applied data augmentation techniques like rotation, flipping, and zooming to make the model more robust and prevent overfitting.

Model Development
Baseline CNN Model:
I built a simple CNN with convolutional, pooling, and fully connected layers.
The initial accuracy was decent, but I noticed overfitting due to the limited dataset.

Transfer Learning Approach:
To improve performance, I used a pre-trained model like VGG16/ResNet50 as a feature extractor.
I fine-tuned the last few layers to adapt the model for cat/dog classification.
This significantly improved accuracy and reduced the need for extensive training data.
Training & Evaluation
I trained the model using categorical cross-entropy loss and the Adam optimizer. I monitored accuracy and loss while training on a split dataset (training and validation sets). After several epochs, I achieved over 90% accuracy with the transfer learning approach, which was a significant improvement over the baseline CNN.
