A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is a powerful deep-learning model used for image analysis tasks, including facial recognition and makeup recommendations. It consists of convolutional layers that extract spatial features, followed by fully connected layers for classification.

Transfer Learning for Makeup Recommendation
Instead of training a CNN from scratch, transfer learning can be applied using a pre-trained model like VGG16, ResNet, or MobileNet. These models have already learned general image features and can be fine-tuned for makeup classification. The key advantages of transfer learning include:

Faster training since the model already knows how to detect shapes, colors, and textures.
Better accuracy with limited data, as pre-trained models have been trained on large datasets.
Customization by adding new layers to classify different makeup styles (e.g., natural, bold, glam).
How It Works in a Makeup Recommendation System
Feature Extraction – The CNN extracts facial features such as skin tone, face shape, and prominent facial regions (eyes, lips, etc.).
Style Classification – Using transfer learning, the model classifies different makeup styles based on trained datasets.
Personalized Recommendation – The system suggests suitable makeup styles based on detected facial features and user preferences.
By leveraging CNNs and transfer learning, a makeup recommendation system can efficiently analyze faces and provide accurate, personalized suggestions.
