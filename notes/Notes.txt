Enhancing Dog vs. Cat Classification with Transfer Learning
Recently, I revisited the classic dog vs. cat image classification problem with the goal of refining my approach and improving efficiency. While I had previously worked with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), this time I focused on optimizing model performance through better data preprocessing, advanced transfer learning strategies, and hyperparameter tuning.

Dataset Preparation & Preprocessing
I used a publicly available dataset consisting of cat and dog images. This time, I incorporated additional preprocessing techniques:

Image Normalization: Standardized pixel values to improve convergence.
Augmentation Improvements: Instead of basic rotation and flipping, I included brightness adjustment and slight distortions to enhance generalization.
Data Balancing: Ensured the dataset was evenly distributed to prevent bias.
Model Development
Baseline CNN Model
I started with a traditional CNN, similar to my previous approach. While it performed decently, overfitting remained a challenge, especially with a relatively small dataset.

Advanced Transfer Learning Approach
To address overfitting and boost performance, I integrated transfer learning using a pre-trained model. However, instead of simply using a feature extractor, I experimented with:

Different Pre-trained Models: Compared VGG16, ResNet50, and EfficientNetB0 to identify the best-performing architecture.
Layer Freezing Strategies: Initially froze most layers and then selectively unfroze deeper layers for fine-tuning.
Regularization Techniques: Used dropout and L2 regularization to improve generalization.
Training & Evaluation
I optimized training using categorical cross-entropy loss and the Adam optimizer. Additionally, I:

Implemented Learning Rate Scheduling: Adjusted the learning rate dynamically to prevent plateauing.
Tried Different Batch Sizes: Found that smaller batch sizes sometimes improved generalization.
Evaluated Model Interpretability: Used Grad-CAM to visualize which areas of an image influenced predictions the most.
Results & Key Learnings
Achieved 95%+ Accuracy: The fine-tuned EfficientNetB0 outperformed other architectures.
Faster Training Time: With transfer learning, I significantly reduced the number of epochs required.
Better Generalization: Data augmentation and regularization helped prevent overfitting.
Model Interpretability Matters: Grad-CAM provided insights into misclassified images, helping refine the model further.
