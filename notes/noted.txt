Model Training for Image Classification
When training a model for image classification, we typically use Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The process consists of multiple steps:

1. Data Preparation
a. Collecting the Dataset
Images should be relevant to the problem (e.g., cats vs. dogs).
Large datasets help improve model generalization (e.g., ImageNet, CIFAR-10, MNIST).
More diverse images (different angles, lighting, backgrounds) improve performance.
b. Data Preprocessing
Resizing: Ensure all images have the same size (e.g., 224x224 for ResNet).
Normalization: Scale pixel values between [0,1] or [-1,1] (e.g., divide by 255).
Data Augmentation: Helps prevent overfitting by generating variations of images.
Rotation, flipping, zooming, brightness changes, etc.
c. Splitting the Dataset
Training Set (70-80%) → Used to train the model.
Validation Set (10-15%) → Used to tune hyperparameters.
Test Set (10-15%) → Used to evaluate final performance.
