Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are a specialized type of neural network designed for tasks like image classification. Neural networks, in general, aim to replicate the human brain's learning process by taking input, processing it through multiple layers, and generating an output. CNNs stand out due to their unique architecture, which consists of specific types of hidden layers:

Convolutional Layers
ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit) Layers
Pooling Layers
Fully Connected Layer (Final Layer)
These layers can appear multiple times in different sequences but follow a general structure. A CNN always begins with a convolutional layer and ends with a fully connected layer, which is preceded by a final pooling layer. A typical CNN architecture might look like this:

Input → Convolution → ReLU → Convolution → ReLU → Pooling → ReLU → Convolution → ReLU → Pooling → Fully Connected → Output

When an image is fed into a CNN for classification, it undergoes a series of transformations within these layers. Each layer serves a specific function in processing the image data.

Breakdown of CNN Layers:
Convolutional Layers
These layers are the core building blocks of a CNN. The mathematical concept of convolution involves combining two functions to produce a third function. In a CNN, the convolutional layer applies a filter to an input image, producing a feature map that highlights key characteristics such as edges, textures, and shapes. These extracted features help identify objects within an image.

ReLU Layers
Short for Rectified Linear Unit, ReLU is an activation function that introduces non-linearity into the network. It processes the feature map by converting all negative values to zero while keeping positive values unchanged.

Pooling Layers
Pooling is used to reduce the dimensions of an image while preserving its essential features. A filter scans over the input matrix, selecting a single representative value from each subregion to create a smaller output matrix. The most commonly used method is max pooling, which selects the highest value from each subregion. Pooling improves computational efficiency and helps reduce overfitting.

Fully Connected Layer
This is the final stage of the CNN. It takes the processed features from the last pooling layer, aggregates the information, and generates the final classification. Each value in the input vector represents the likelihood of a particular feature belonging to a specific class. For example, one value might indicate a 90% probability that a detected feature is a dog’s paw. The fully connected layer applies weights to these probabilities and determines the final classification output.

In summary, CNNs process images step by step, extracting features, reducing complexity, and ultimately classifying the input based on learned patterns.
