Comparison: CNN vs. Visual Cortex & Insights from the Cat Experiment
Visual Cortex Overview
The visual cortex is responsible for interpreting visual stimuli in the brain.

It processes information in a hierarchical manner:

Early Layers: Identify simple features such as edges, lines, and orientations.

Later Layers: Combine these features into more complex forms like shapes, objects, and faces.

Specific neurons, called receptive fields, respond to particular orientations, such as vertical or horizontal lines.

The Cat Experiment
Conducted by David Hubel and Torsten Wiesel in the 1960s to study neural processing in vision.

Methodology:

Electrodes were implanted in a catâ€™s brain to monitor neural activity.

The cat was shown visual stimuli, such as bars of light at different angles.

Findings:

Feature Detection: Certain neurons activate only when exposed to specific orientations (e.g., vertical lines trigger particular neurons).

Hierarchical Processing:

Lower-level neurons detect basic edges.

Higher-level neurons recognize patterns by combining simpler elements.

Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)
Modeled after the hierarchical structure of the visual cortex to process images efficiently.

Mimics how the brain extracts and refines visual features step by step.

Similarities Between CNNs and the Visual Cortex
Feature Detection:

Early layers identify basic visual elements like edges.

Deeper layers assemble these features into complex patterns.

Hierarchical Processing: Information is processed in stages, from simple to sophisticated structures.

Efficiency: CNNs use pooling mechanisms similar to how the brain filters out unnecessary details and focuses on key information.

Significance of the Cat Experiment
Demonstrated how the brain detects visual features.

Provided a biological basis for designing CNNs.

Established that hierarchical learning, from detecting edges to recognizing full objects, is crucial for visual recognition.

Key Takeaways
CNNs are inspired by the visual cortex and its method of processing images.

The cat experiment played a pivotal role in connecting neuroscience with artificial intelligence.

Hierarchical feature learning is the fundamental principle that drives both CNNs and biological vision.
