Key Steps in Backpropagation:
1. Forward Pass:
Data moves through the network, generating predictions and calculating the loss.

2. Backward Pass:
The loss is differentiated with respect to weights, biases, and activations.
Gradients are passed backward from the output layer to earlier layers.

Layer-Specific Backpropagation:
Convolutional Layers:

Gradients for filter weights are computed.

This is done by convolving the input feature maps with the gradients of the output.

Filters are updated using gradient descent.

Pooling Layers:

These layers don't have learnable parameters.

In max pooling, only the location of the maximum value in the input receives the gradient.

Fully Connected Layers:

Gradients are calculated for each weight and bias, much like traditional neural networks.

Mathematical Foundations:
The chain rule is applied across layers to compute partial derivatives.

In convolutional layers, gradient computations involve element-wise multiplications and summations across input channels.

Common Backpropagation Issues:
Vanishing Gradients:

Gradients shrink significantly in deep networks, making learning slow or stagnant.

ReLU activation functions help address this problem.

Exploding Gradients:

Gradients grow uncontrollably, leading to training instability.

This is handled through gradient clipping or normalization techniques.

Practical Tips:
Manual implementation of backpropagation demands optimized matrix operations.

Libraries like TensorFlow and PyTorch handle gradient computation automatically, but understanding the underlying process is crucial for effective debugging and model tuning.

Role of Backpropagation in CNNs:
It's responsible for updating all weights and biases to reduce the model's loss.

Crucial for training CNNs in applications like image classification and object detection.

Final Thoughts:
While backpropagation in CNNs can be intricate, it fundamentally follows the same logic as in other neural networks.
Understanding it well enhances your ability to train models efficiently and improve their accuracy.
