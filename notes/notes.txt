Transfer learning is a machine learning technique where a model trained for one task is repurposed as the foundation for a new, related task. In Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), this method is widely used by leveraging pre-trained models, often trained on large datasets like ImageNet, and fine-tuning them for specific tasks with smaller datasets. This approach is particularly beneficial when data for the new task is limited, as it enables the model to retain and utilize the general features learned from the original dataset.

CNNs are effective at capturing spatial hierarchies of features, with early layers detecting basic patterns such as edges and textures, while deeper layers extract more complex, high-level representations. In transfer learning, the lower layers of a pre-trained CNN typically contain generalized features applicable across various domains, whereas the upper layers can be fine-tuned to suit the specific needs of the target task.

By employing transfer learning, training time and computational costs are significantly reduced. Additionally, it enhances model performance, especially in scenarios with limited labeled data, by leveraging the rich feature representations already acquired during pre-training. Rather than building a CNN from scratch—which demands extensive data and computational resources—transfer learning enables quicker convergence and improved accuracy with fewer data points.
