Problems & Solutions for Lumiereâ€™s Image Makeup Style Recommendations Using CNN
1. Inaccurate Makeup Suggestions
Problem: The Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) may provide inaccurate makeup style recommendations due to limited or biased training data.
Solution: Improve dataset diversity by including images of different skin tones, face shapes, and lighting conditions. Use data augmentation techniques and continuously retrain the model with user feedback.

2. Poor Image Quality and Lighting Issues
Problem: Low-quality images, poor lighting, or overexposed/underexposed images may affect model predictions.
Solution: Implement pre-processing techniques like image enhancement, contrast adjustment, and noise reduction before feeding images into the CNN.

3. Difficulty in Detecting Facial Features Accurately
Problem: The CNN may struggle with occlusions (glasses, hair covering parts of the face) or extreme facial angles.
Solution: Integrate facial landmark detection models (like dlib or MediaPipe) to improve feature localization before applying makeup recommendations.

4. Ethical and Bias Concerns
Problem: The model might favor certain makeup styles based on biased training data, leading to recommendations that do not suit all ethnicities or preferences.
Solution: Conduct bias audits, collect diverse datasets, and allow users to provide feedback to adjust recommendations.

5. Privacy & Security Issues
Problem: Users may be concerned about their uploaded images being stored or misused.
Solution: Implement strict data policies, use encrypted storage, and provide an option for users to delete their images after processing.
