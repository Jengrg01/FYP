What is OpenCV?
OpenCV is a popular open-source library designed for computer vision and image processing tasks. It enables the manipulation of images and videos, offering functionalities like filtering, transformations, and feature extraction. Common applications include face recognition, object detection, and edge detection.

Significance of Image Processing
Enhances image quality for better analysis.
Extracts useful information from images to aid decision-making.
Automates visual tasks, making it essential in fields such as healthcare, autonomous vehicles, and robotics.
Key Image Processing Techniques in OpenCV
1. Image Representation
Images are stored as matrices, where each element represents a pixel.
Grayscale images contain intensity values ranging from 0 to 255, while color images use three channels (RGB).
2. Image Enhancement
Methods such as brightness adjustment, contrast enhancement, and histogram equalization improve image clarity.
3. Image Filtering
Blurring (Smoothing): Reduces noise and fine details.
Sharpening: Enhances edges and fine details in an image.
4. Geometric Transformations
Operations like scaling, rotation, translation, and flipping modify an imageâ€™s size or orientation.
5. Edge Detection
Techniques such as the Canny and Sobel operators identify boundaries within images, crucial for object recognition.
6. Image Segmentation
Divides an image into distinct regions to isolate specific objects or areas.
7. Color Space Conversions
Converts images between different color models (e.g., RGB to HSV) for specialized applications.
8. Morphological Operations
Erosion and Dilation: Modify image structures by shrinking or expanding pixels, useful for noise removal and object separation.
Applications of OpenCV
Healthcare: Used in medical imaging, including MRI and X-ray analysis.
Automotive: Facilitates lane detection and obstacle recognition in self-driving cars.
Security: Powers face recognition for authentication and surveillance.
Retail: Enables barcode and QR code scanning.
