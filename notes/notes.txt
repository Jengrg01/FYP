Transfer learning is a technique in machine learning where a model trained for one task is repurposed for a different but related task. Instead of building a model from the ground up, especially in neural networks, transfer learning starts with an already trained model. This pre-trained model benefits from being exposed to large datasets, and its parameters are already fine-tuned for learning efficiency.

How Transfer Learning Operates
In neural networks, the early layers typically learn to detect simple patterns like edges, the middle layers recognize more complex shapes, and the later layers focus on task-specific features. Transfer learning retains the early and middle layers and only fine-tunes the later layers for the new task. This approach utilizes the labeled data from the original training task effectively.

Common Transfer Learning Methods
Training Once, Reusing Later: Train a model and adapt it for different but related tasks.

Using Pre-Trained Models: Employ models trained on large datasets like ImageNet as a base.

Feature Extraction: Use the learned features of a model for a new classification or regression task.

Advantages of Transfer Learning
Faster Training: Since the model has already learned useful patterns, it requires less time and computation to adapt to a new task.

Better Generalization: Pre-trained models, trained on large and varied datasets, capture general features that work well even with limited new data.

Avoids Poor Convergence: Starting with optimized weights helps the model avoid poor local minima and reach better performance more reliably.

Lower Annotation Effort: It reduces the need for large amounts of labeled data, making it ideal when labeling is costly or time-intensive.
