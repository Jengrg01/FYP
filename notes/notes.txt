Padding
Definition: Padding involves adding extra pixels around the edges of an input image.

Purpose:

Preserving Spatial Dimensions: Maintains the input's original width and height in the output feature map, preventing size reduction after convolution.

Enhancing Edge Feature Detection: Ensures convolution filters can effectively process edge and corner pixels, capturing important boundary details.

Types of Padding:

Valid Padding (No Padding): No additional pixels are added, leading to a smaller output feature map.

Same Padding (Zero Padding): Zeros are added around the input to maintain the same dimensions in the output.

2. Strides
Definition: Stride refers to the step size by which the filter moves across the input matrix during convolution.

Purpose:

Controlling Output Size: The stride value influences the spatial dimensions of the resulting feature map.

Optimizing Computation: Larger strides reduce the output size, minimizing memory usage and computational cost.

Stride Variations:

Stride of 1: The filter shifts by one pixel at a time, generating a highly detailed feature map.

Stride of 2 or More: The filter moves multiple pixels at a time, resulting in a smaller feature map with lower spatial resolution.

3. Key Considerations
Information Loss: Larger stride values can lead to loss of finer details in the feature map.

Computational Impact: Smaller strides and more padding increase computational demands due to larger output sizes.

Balancing Design Choices: Selecting the right combination of padding and stride is essential for optimizing both efficiency and feature extraction.
