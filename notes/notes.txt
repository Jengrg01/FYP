Padding
Definition: Padding involves adding extra pixels around the edges of an input image before applying convolution.

Purpose:

Maintains Spatial Dimensions: Helps retain the input image’s width and height, preventing size reduction after convolution.
Enhances Edge Detection: Ensures filters can effectively process features near the image’s borders, capturing important details.
Types of Padding:

Valid Padding (No Padding): No extra pixels are added, resulting in a smaller output after convolution.
Same Padding (Zero Padding): Zeros are added to the image borders to maintain the same input and output dimensions.
2. Strides
Definition: Stride refers to the number of pixels a filter moves over the input matrix during convolution.

Purpose:

Controls Output Size: Adjusting stride length influences the spatial dimensions of the resulting feature map.
Improves Efficiency: Larger strides reduce output size, lowering computational complexity and memory usage.
Stride Values:

Stride of 1: The filter moves one pixel at a time, generating a highly detailed feature map.
Stride of 2 or More: The filter shifts by multiple pixels, producing a smaller feature map with reduced resolution.
3. Key Considerations
Information Retention: Larger strides may cause a loss of fine details in the feature map.
Computational Cost: Smaller strides and more padding increase processing requirements due to larger output sizes.
Optimal Design: Choosing appropriate padding and stride values is essential for balancing computational efficiency and feature extraction.
