NNs (Convolutional Neural Networks) are a specialized type of neural network designed for processing structured grid data, such as images. Like the human brain, they take input, process it through multiple layers, and generate an output. What makes CNNs unique is their specific layer architecture, which includes:

Convolutional layers

ReLU layers

Pooling layers

Fully connected layers

These layers can appear multiple times within a CNN, but their order follows a general pattern. A CNN typically begins with a convolutional layer and ends with a fully connected layer. The final pooling layer comes just before the fully connected layer. An example architecture might look like this:

Input → Convolution → ReLU → Convolution → ReLU → Pooling → ReLU → Convolution → ReLU → Pooling → Fully Connected → Output

CNNs are widely used for image classification tasks. They take an image’s pixel values as input, pass them through various layers, and output either a single class or a probability distribution across multiple classes.

Key Layers and Their Functions
Convolutional Layers
These are the core components of CNNs. The term "convolution" refers to combining two functions (input and filter) to produce a third function (feature map). A convolutional layer extracts essential features from an image, such as edges, textures, or shapes. This feature extraction process allows the network to recognize patterns in images.

ReLU Layers (Rectified Linear Units)
ReLU layers introduce non-linearity into the model by converting negative values to zero while keeping positive values unchanged. This helps the network learn complex patterns more effectively.

Pooling Layers
Pooling reduces the spatial dimensions of the feature maps, speeding up computation while retaining the most important information. The most common pooling method is max pooling, which selects the highest value in each subregion.

Fully Connected Layer
The final layer of a CNN aggregates all extracted features and maps them to class probabilities. Each input value represents the likelihood of a feature belonging to a certain class. The network then applies weights and generates the final classification.

By combining these specialized layers, CNNs efficiently process images, recognizing and categorizing objects with high accuracy.
