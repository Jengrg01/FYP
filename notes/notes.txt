 Understanding CNNs for Image Training
CNNs are specialized neural networks designed for processing structured grid data, such as images.
They extract spatial hierarchies of features using convolutional layers.
2. Data Preparation
Dataset Collection: Use diverse and high-quality images related to the target task.
Data Labeling: Ensure correct annotation of images for supervised learning.
Normalization: Scale pixel values (e.g., 0 to 1 or -1 to 1) to speed up training.
Augmentation: Apply transformations like rotation, flipping, and cropping to increase dataset variability.
Splitting: Divide the dataset into training, validation, and test sets (e.g., 70-20-10 split).
3. CNN Architecture
Convolutional Layers: Extract features using filters/kernels.
Activation Functions: Commonly use ReLU to introduce non-linearity.
Pooling Layers: Reduce dimensionality while retaining important features (MaxPooling, AveragePooling).
Fully Connected Layers: Perform classification based on extracted features.
Dropout Layers: Prevent overfitting by randomly deactivating neurons.
4. Training Process
Loss Function: Use categorical cross-entropy (multi-class) or binary cross-entropy (binary classification).
Optimizer: Use Adam, SGD, or RMSprop for weight updates.
Batch Size & Epochs: Tune for optimal performance (e.g., batch size = 32, epochs = 50â€“100).
Learning Rate Scheduling: Reduce learning rate over epochs to refine training.
5. Model Evaluation & Improvement
Validation Accuracy vs. Training Accuracy: Monitor for overfitting.
Confusion Matrix & Precision-Recall: Evaluate classification performance.
Fine-tuning & Transfer Learning: Use pre-trained models (ResNet, VGG, EfficientNet) for better results.
Hyperparameter Tuning: Experiment with different architectures, optimizers, and dropout rates.
6. Deployment Considerations
Model Compression: Use quantization and pruning for lightweight models.
Inference Speed Optimization: Convert models to TensorRT, ONNX, or TFLite for real-world applications.
Continuous Learning: Update model periodically with new data to maintain accuracy.
