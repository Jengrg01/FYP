1. Introduction to LeNet-5:

	Developed by: Yann LeCun and his colleagues in 1998.

	Purpose: Designed for handwritten digit recognition, particularly on the MNIST dataset.

	Significance: One of the pioneering CNN architectures that demonstrated the effectiveness of deep learning in image recognition tasks.

2. Architecture Overview:

	LeNet-5 consists of seven layers (excluding the input) with learnable parameters:
	
	Input Layer: Accepts a 32x32 pixel grayscale image.

    Layer 1 - Convolutional Layer (C1):

	Filter Size: 6 filters of size 5x5.

	Output: 6 feature maps of size 28x28.

	Activation: Sigmoid function.

    Layer 2 - Subsampling Layer (S2):

	Type: Average pooling.

	Filter Size: 2x2 with a stride of 2.

	Output: 6 feature maps of size 14x14.

    Layer 3 - Convolutional Layer (C3):

	Filter Size: 16 filters of size 5x5.

	Output: 16 feature maps of size 10x10.

	Activation: Sigmoid function.
	
    Layer 4 - Subsampling Layer (S4):

	Type: Average pooling.

	Filter Size: 2x2 with a stride of 2.

	Output: 16 feature maps of size 5x5.

     Layer 5 - Convolutional Layer (C5):

	Filter Size: 120 filters of size 5x5.

	Output: 120 feature maps of size 1x1.

	Activation: Sigmoid function.

     Layer 6 - Fully Connected Layer (F6):

	Neurons: 84.

	Activation: Sigmoid function.

     Output Layer:

	Neurons: 10 (one for each digit 0-9).

	Activation: Softmax function to produce probability distribution.

3. Key Features:

	Convolutional Layers: Extract spatial features through learned filters.

	Subsampling (Pooling) Layers: Reduce dimensionality and computation, and provide translation invariance.

	Fully Connected Layers: Integrate features for classification.

4. Training Details:

	Dataset: MNIST handwritten digits.

	Loss Function: Mean Squared Error (MSE).

	Optimizer: Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD).

5. Impact and Legacy:

	Foundation for Modern CNNs: LeNet-5's architecture influenced subsequent deep learning models.
	
	Demonstrated Feasibility: Showed that neural networks could effectively perform image recognition tasks.
