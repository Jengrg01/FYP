Feature Extraction vs. Fine-Tuning in CNNs
Feature Extraction
A pre-trained CNN is used to extract features from images.
All convolutional layers remain frozen, and only a new classifier is trained on top.
Works well for small datasets when the new task is similar to the original dataset of the pre-trained model.
Faster and requires fewer computational resources.
Used when:

Data is limited, and a quick, efficient solution is needed.
The new task is similar to the pre-trained modelâ€™s original task (e.g., using ImageNet features for general object recognition).
Fine-Tuning
Some or all layers of the pre-trained CNN are unfrozen and retrained on the new dataset.
Helps adapt the model to task-specific features.
Requires more data and computational power but improves accuracy for domain-specific tasks.
Used when:

A larger dataset is available, and higher accuracy is required.
The new task differs significantly from the original dataset (e.g., fine-tuning a model trained on ImageNet for medical imaging).
