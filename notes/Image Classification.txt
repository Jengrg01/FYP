1. Convolution Layer
The main building block of CNNs.
Uses filters (kernels) to extract features from an image.
Each filter scans the image and detects patterns like edges, shapes, or textures.
The output is called a feature map.
Example: A filter detecting vertical lines looks for specific pixel arrangements.

2. ReLU Layer (Rectified Linear Unit)
An activation function that introduces non-linearity.
Converts all negative values in the feature map to zero, while positive values remain unchanged.
Ensures the model can handle complex patterns instead of only linear relationships.

3. Pooling Layer
Reduces the image size while preserving important information.
Speeds up computation and makes the model more efficient.
The most common type is Max Pooling, which selects the highest value from a region of pixels.


4. Fully Connected Layer
The final stage of CNN.
Takes the extracted features and weights them to generate a final classification.


Summary of CNN Process
The image is converted into numerical pixel values.
Convolutional layers extract features by scanning the image with filters.
ReLU layers introduce non-linearity by rectifying negative values.
Pooling layers reduce image size to improve efficiency.
Fully connected layers classify the image based on extracted features.
CNNs allow computers to classify images with high accuracy and are widely used in AI applications.
