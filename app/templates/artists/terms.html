                <p>Lumiere provides a platform connecting users with makeup artists. We do not employ makeup artists directly; we facilitate connections between independent makeup artists and clients.</p>
                <p>While we strive to verify the credentials and quality of makeup artists on our platform, we do not guarantee their services. Users book makeup artists at their own risk.</p>
                
                <h4>3.2 Makeup Style Recommendation Feature</h4>
                <p>Our makeup style recommendation feature uses technology to analyze user-uploaded photos and suggest suitable makeup styles.</p>
                <p>Recommendations are provided for informational purposes only and do not constitute professional advice.</p>
                <p>The accuracy of recommendations depends on various factors, including photo quality, lighting, and other technical considerations.</p>

                <p>By uploading photos, you grant Lumiere a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free license to use, store, display, reproduce, and analyze your photos solely for the purpose of providing and improving our Services.</p>
